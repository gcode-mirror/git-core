git-update-server-info(1)
=========================

NAME
----
git-update-server-info - Update auxiliary info file to help dumb servers


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git update-server-info' [--force]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A dumb server that does not do on-the-fly pack generations must
have some auxiliary information files in $GIT_DIR/info and
$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY/info directories to help clients discover
what references and packs the server has.

A future protocol update will allow a server to respond to a "git
clone" request by first telling the client to fetch a pre-made
bundle file and then fetch from it.  To prepare such a server,
the pre-made bundle file `$GIT_DIR/clone.bundle` needs to be
kept up to date.

This command generates such auxiliary files.


OPTIONS
-------

-f::
--force::
	Update the info files from scratch.


OUTPUT
------

Currently the command updates the following files.  Please see
linkgit:gitrepository-layout[5] for description of
what they are for:

* objects/info/packs

* info/refs

* clone.bundle
